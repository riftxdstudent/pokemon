# Pokemon Base
## Gravel Frontend Engineer Internships Challenge
## Purpose

Pok√©mon Base was created with the aim of making it easier for users to find out the details of the Pokemon that they are searching for. They can also capture Pokemon, and they can release Pokemon that have been captured.

## Tech

Pokemon Base is built with this technology stack:

- React Js (JavaScript Framework)
- TailwindCSS (CSS Framework)
- DaisyUI (TailwindCSS Framework)

And of course Pokemon Base itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/riftxdstudent/pokemon) on GitHub.
